## Goal

Teach people to be careful with personal data

## Background
We are putting more and more of our personal data online.
Often lives on forever.
And through advanced machine learning is starting to become realistic to create AI representation of a person based on this data.

## How> myex.ai

Making the experience emotional:

* Allow to have basic interactions with 'the person'
* Bring up some intimate details from past conversations. An edgy statement,picture etc
* Allow to change the personality of 'the person'. Slider
* Match the ex to a (group of) active people online (Instagram etc), and use their photos with face transfer

Bring people to informational/howto on personal data management.

0. Put less personal/sensitive online
1. Use privacy-respecting services
2. Improve privacy settings on services you use
3. Delete your presence from services that you no longer use

Needs to be deep.
Keep it simple. One modality. Ex: text/chatapp. SMS style
