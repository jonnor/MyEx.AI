## Goal

Teach people to be careful with personal data

## Background
We are putting more and more of our personal data online.
Often lives on forever.
And through advanced machine learning is starting to become realistic to create AI representation of a person based on this data.

## How> myex.ai

Invite people to a fake product launch of an AI startup that plausibly abuses personal data:
An AI boyfriend/girlfriend service which lets you 

Making the experience emotional:

* Allow to have basic interactions with 'the person'
* Bring up some intimate details from past conversations. An edgy statement,picture etc
* Allow to change the personality of 'the person'. Slider
* Match the ex to a (group of) active people online (Instagram etc), and use their photos with face transfer

Bring people to informational/howto on personal data management.

0. Put less personal/sensitive online
1. Use privacy-respecting services
2. Improve privacy settings on services you use
3. Delete your presence from services that you no longer use

## Content

Google knows where you have been, everything you have ever searched and deleted. Managing to gain access to someoneâ€™s Google account lets you have a diary of everything that person has done. Knows your workout routine, how many steps you have made, every mail you ever sent and there is more.

Facebook has an option to download all your information. It stores everything, from messages to your login location. 
Facebook also stores what it think you might be interested in based off the things you have liked and what you and your friends talk about
They also store every time you log into Facebook, where you logged in from, what time, and from what device.

## Feedback Stefania Wed

What are my sliders?
Needs to be deep.
Keep it simple. One modality. Ex: text/chatapp. SMS style
Top 5 posts, top 5 pictures

chatbot example: Hugging Face

Simplest way to get the information:
Core interation. What makes people go 'oh my god'
Google API. Make text (and voice) in a certain style
John Oliver

Crytoigraphy toolkit for kids.

Ask the question: Do you want this to be real?

### Story

Background.

We've a AI startup that has been in stealth mode for the last 6 months.
Today we are proud to show you a first peak and demo of our product: MyEx.AI

Who here has broken up with someone?

Rick and Anna were together for a few years.
However Anna was not happy and recently left Rick, feeling better off without him.

Rick on the other hand thought things were going great, and wanted to continue the relationship.
With MyEx.AI we give him that possibility.


Facebook status changed
Guy gets target ad (suggested post) for MyEx.AI


### Video

Getting started is is super easy.
You just type in the persons name,
link their public profiles,
and upload the conversations you have had together on Facebook, WhatsApp etc.
You don't even need their permission!
-- app: signup,upload

Using Machine Learning on their data we build up an AI matching their personality:
communication style, interests and preferences.
Everything comes from the online data: likes, status updates, posted pictures and conversations.
-- app: processing
-- app: personality sliders

Of course you can also change the persons traits, to make them behave more to your liking.
-- app: change sliders

You can chat with your AI partner.
It can smalltalk, support you when you are down and help you make decisions.
-- app: chat, where to eat (hint: monetization,sponsored ad)

Your partner can also send you fresh pictures of themselves.
Using the face2face algorithm we map their face onto photos retrieved from the Internet
from real personalities similar to your EX
-- app chat, at the gym, working out (PIC)


So next time someone breaks up with you, consider using MyEx.AI to continue your relationship !

## Outro

Wait, whaaaat?

-- Switch to reveal
Don't worry. 
This is NOT a real startup. We have not built this product or intend to.
However

(but it could have been)!
Much of the technology is available today, to some degree.

Questions

- who has got data about you that you are not comfortable with
We think we are pretty data savy
Did you look at your FB,WhatApp data recently?
We did, and found things we were quite uncomfortable with

- when is it OK to build a digital representation of a person
Maybe a breakup is clear cut. Anna did not consent.

But what if the person has passed away?




##  Feedback Stef Thurs

## In-app ideas

Exploring the system. What can I/it do
Personalized. Nickname
Status update. Doing right now
Memories from the past
Suggestions. Where to eat?


What is the finale??
Juust before taking it to far, suggestive

## Post-workshop ideas
Make a tool that lets users scan their FB,WhatApp conversations for sensitive data.
Intimate,embarrasing,secrets.
To show them that maybe they are not as careful as they like to think.

Make a more polished 'launch video'. Kickstarter style
