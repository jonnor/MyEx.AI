## Goal

Teach people to be careful with personal data

## Background
We are putting more and more of our personal data online.
Often lives on forever.
And through advanced machine learning is starting to become realistic to create AI representation of a person based on this data.

## How> myex.ai

Invite people to a fake product launch of an AI startup that plausibly abuses personal data:
An AI boyfriend/girlfriend service which lets you 

Making the experience emotional:

* Allow to have basic interactions with 'the person'
* Bring up some intimate details from past conversations. An edgy statement,picture etc
* Allow to change the personality of 'the person'. Slider
* Match the ex to a (group of) active people online (Instagram etc), and use their photos with face transfer

Bring people to informational/howto on personal data management.

0. Put less personal/sensitive online
1. Use privacy-respecting services
2. Improve privacy settings on services you use
3. Delete your presence from services that you no longer use

Facebook has an option to download all your information. It stores everything, from messages to your login location. 
Facebook also stores what it think you might be interested in based off the things you have liked and what you and your friends talk about

Needs to be deep.

Simplest way to get the information:
Core interation. What makes people go 'oh my god'
Google API. Make text (and voice) in a certain style

## Outro

-- Switch to reveal
This is not a real startup (but it could have been)!
Much of the technology is available today, to some degree.

- when is it OK to build a digital representation of a person without their consent
- who can use shared data after you a relationship.
Breakup, or someone has passed away
- who has got data about you that you are not comfortable with.
Exercise: Download your FB,WhatsApp data and look at the conversations with your close ones
