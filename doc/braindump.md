Making the experience emotional:

* Allow to have basic interactions with 'the person'
* Bring up some intimate details from past conversations. An edgy statement,picture etc
* Allow to change the personality of 'the person'. Slider
* Match the ex to a (group of) active people online (Instagram etc), and use their photos with face transfer

Bring people to informational/howto on personal data management.

0. Put less personal/sensitive online
1. Use privacy-respecting services
2. Improve privacy settings on services you use
3. Delete your presence from services that you no longer use

What are my sliders?
Needs to be deep.
Keep it simple. One modality. Ex: text/chatapp. SMS style
