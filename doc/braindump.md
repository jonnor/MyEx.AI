## Goal

Teach people to be careful with personal data

## Background
We are putting more and more of our personal data online.
Often lives on forever.
And through advanced machine learning is starting to become realistic to create AI representation of a person based on this data.

## How> myex.ai

Invite people to a fake product launch of an AI startup that plausibly abuses personal data:
An AI boyfriend/girlfriend service which lets you 

Making the experience emotional:

* Allow to have basic interactions with 'the person'
* Bring up some intimate details from past conversations. An edgy statement,picture etc
* Allow to change the personality of 'the person'. Slider
* Match the ex to a (group of) active people online (Instagram etc), and use their photos with face transfer

Bring people to informational/howto on personal data management.

0. Put less personal/sensitive online
1. Use privacy-respecting services
2. Improve privacy settings on services you use
3. Delete your presence from services that you no longer use

What are my sliders?
Needs to be deep.
Keep it simple. One modality. Ex: text/chatapp. SMS style
Top 5 posts, top 5 pictures

chatbot example: Hugging Face

Simplest way to get the information:
Core interation. What makes people go 'oh my god'
Google API. Make text (and voice) in a certain style
