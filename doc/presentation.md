### Story

We've a AI startup that has been in stealth mode for the last 6 months.
Today we are proud to show you a first peak and demo of our product: MyEx.AI


### MyEx.AI
Who here has broken up with someone?

Rick and Anna were together for a few years.
However Anna was not happy and recently left Rick, feeling better off without him.

Rick on the other hand thought things were going great, and wanted to continue the relationship.
With MyEx.AI we give him that possibility.

MyEx.AI is an app which allows Rick to build a interactive AI persona based on Annas data.

## AD
So when we notice that Facebook status change, we target ad (suggested post) for MyEx.AI.

### Add data
Getting started is is super easy.
-> You don't even need their permission!

You just type in the persons name,
link their public profiles,
and upload the conversations you have had together on Facebook, WhatsApp etc.

### Processing
Using Machine Learning on their online data:
likes, status updates, posted pictures and conversations.

We build up an AI matching their personality:
communication style, interests and preferences.

### Personality,change
Of course you can also change the persons traits, to make them behave more to your liking.
Maybe Anna needed to up here Agreeableness a bit.

### Chat, memories
You can chat with your AI partner.
It can smalltalk, support you when you are down
and remind you of good times you've had together.

### New picture
But your partner can also send you fresh pictures of themselves.
Using pictures from a real person similar to your ex,
we use the Face2Face algorithm we map their face onto photo.

### Dirty
Of course there are all kinds of images on the Internet,
so you can request ANY IMAGE YOU WANT


At this point you might be thinking....

## Outro

Wait, whaaaat? Thats crazy

And you are right.
Don't worry. 
This is NOT a real startup.
We have not built this product, nor intend to.

But someone could probably make it! If not today, then maybe soon.

The machine learning technology to build this product is more or less available,
and there is more and more data available.

## Who has got data
Who has got data about you that you are not comfortable with.
Social media companies, old friends and exes.

I consider myself pretty pretty data concious.
But when I looked at my personal online data,
I found things we were quite uncomfortable with

## When is AI someone OK

When is it OK to build an AI representation of a person?
Maybe a breakup is clear cut. Anna did not consent.
But what it was not a breakup, but the person passed away?
